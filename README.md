This is a server-side rendering Java Spring Boot application.
The application has unit and integration tests included, as well as a database preserving the information of logged and registered users.
The application has the option of searching and filtering movies by their category.
It has also various links and URLs making the user experience as much as it is possible.
The app includes things, such as:
-> Option of adding a movie when a certain user has ADMIN authorities.
-> Login and Register pages.
-> Movie review pages, including the possibility of ordering a ticket, watching video trailers and reading movie descriptions.
-> Profile page, having all the necessary information and options, such as password change, account deletion, and dismissing ticket reservations.
-> Spring security implemented as all-rounded security, as well as some basic FRONT-END validations with Bootstrap and validations on the BACK-END layer.
